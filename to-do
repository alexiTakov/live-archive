low priority ...
  ctrl-alt-a should go back one version when replay showing
  show busy indicator on slow ops

future ... 
  getFirstVisibleScreenRow is screen pos
  load time is 750ms
  ruler
  UI for disabling archiving on project

bad behavior ...
  versions with no diff highlighting
  update dialog when buffer has external changes
  stop diff srch on ver showing del marker, not empty next one
  show something on deletes in actual vers page

bugs ...
  minimap overlaps (use appendBottom)
  cannot open with an empty project or an untitled folder

  ctrl-z until tab empty, cancel edit history warning -> atom closes
  editor crashes on split up with one source and one replay
